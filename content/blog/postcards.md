When we'd finally decided to visit my wife's family for Christmas and New Year, I began to ponder what, if any, photo equipment to bring. Over the years, I have accumulated a motley of photographic gear, most of which now sits in a cupboard collecting dust: digital cameras, 35mm cameras, a couple of medium format cameras, and of course a sprawling collection of lenses, filters and other paraphernalia. Somehow the pandemic had quenched my thirst for photography, and after some fun at-home experiments in multiple exposure on medium format during the first lockdown, I hadn't really picked up a camera in two years.

Had I had the energy to be any more methodical about this choice (it was mid-December, after a very tiresome year), I would have packed an assortment of things: probably a 35mm body and a range of lenses from 28mm to 200mm. This would have covered everything from landscape to portraiture and beyond, and in a reasonably compact setup. But the sheer ridiculousness of owning so much *stuff* and still being dissatisfied with what I could achieve with it prompted another response in me. It was time to try something more minimalist, to look for more in less. So, without really thinking about it, I threw my trusty old Minolta SRT 101 (by now about 50 years of age, a fully mechanical wonder that's never failed me), one prime lens (the compact 45mm f/2.0 MD Rokkor, a true "sleeper" among the Minolta primes) and a Sekonic light meter in my bag. When I arrived at my destination, I loaded the camera with the first colour negative film that I could easily come across, the lowly Kodak ColorPlus 200, and proceeded to shoot another four rolls of those.

I was blown away by the results. Audiophiles often extol the virtues of vinyl over digital formats -- and while I've never been completely persuaded by this argument (in music, I'm not listening to the bits or to the analogue waveform, but rather to the composition and the performance), when it comes to photography I totally buy it. In photography, I am in fact appreciating the pixels or the grains -- they are part and parcel of the gestalt of the photo. For me, there *is* a lovely vividness and fragility to photos shot on film, a certain I-know-not-what that justifies continued involvement with the analogue medium.

Could this effect be reproduced using digital means? Absolutely. Does it make any economical sense to continue practicing analogue photography in an increasingly digital world, in which a roll of ColorPlus costs closer to 10 euros? Not at all. Does it make any moral sense for someone concerned with animal welfare and environmental conservation to capture pictures by means of silver particles suspended in an emulsion of gelatin? Also no.

To find the virtues of analogue photography one must look further beyond these immediate reflections. I, personally, am not looking for *sense*, to begin with. In practicing analogue photography, I am looking for a way out, an escape, a means of slowing down.

I have decided to call these photographs postcards, for they are surely not splendid works of art, but I do think they picture pretty things and pretty settings in a pretty way. Much like postcards -- another almost forgotten technology -- do.
