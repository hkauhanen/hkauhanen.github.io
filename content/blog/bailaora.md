When the pandemic hit, I briefly looked for new inspiration for photography indoors before suddenly losing all passion for the hobby for about two years. This photo is one of the last I took before those two years of photographic depression.

Multiple exposure is a fun technique. Flamenco is a complex dance. I wanted to use the former to try to capture some of the complexity of the latter. So we pushed the living room sofa into a corner and my wife was generous enough to model in front of an ancient Minolta Autocord twin lens reflex camera propped on a tripod. (It's a tremendously fun camera by the way -- I will have to write more about it on a separate occasion.)

This was six exposures for a total exposure of 3 seconds at f/11, shot on Fomapan 100 and developed with Rodinal.
