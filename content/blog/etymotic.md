The Etymotic ER2XR is an interesting pair
of in-ear monitor (IEM) headphones.
Intended to be inserted very deep in
the ear canal, they boast up to about
40 dB of isolation. This means, in
theory at least, that one may listen
at more moderate sound pressure
levels; there is less need of drowning
ambient noise with excessive volume.
The headphones have garnered mostly positive,
and sometimes extremely positive, reviews
on the internet. Lacking a good
pair of IEMs, I decided to give them
a try. The ER2 come in two varieties,
ER2SE ("Studio Edition") and ER2XR
("eXtended Range"), the latter sporting
a bit of bass boost. I confess to being
a bit of a bass-head, and hence
picked up the ER2XR.


## The unboxing

The headphones come in a no-nonsense
cardboard package with foam inserts.
Included is a soft carrying case,
various differently shaped and sized
eartips (one pair foam, others rubber),
a shirt clip, replacement filters, and a filter
replacement tool. The headphones
themselves are very attractive in their
blue aluminium casing.
The nothing-to-write-home-about cable
is detachable and terminates in a
3.5mm phone jack. No adapter to
6.3mm is provided.


## The fit

With IEMs in general, and with the
Etymotics in particular, a good fit
is essential: a loose fit leads to
loss of isolation and, in particular,
loss of bass response. Using the
default, factory-fitted 3-flange
eartips, I was initially unimpressed
by the sound quality. It was
only when I randomly happened to clench my
jaw while listening that I
realized the importance of fit.
I changed the eartips to one
of the 2-flange pairs -- slightly larger in diameter -- and the
difference was like night and
day.

As previously mentioned, these
headphones sit deep in the ear
canal. The pressure required for
a tight fit may become tiring
after a while. I would hesitate to
pick up the Etymotics for extended
listening if other headphones
of similar sonic quality were to
hand. To find out in what
situations I would and do pick
them up, read on.


## The sound

Once a good fit has been secured,
the listener is in for a delightful
surprise. These headphones sound
very natural and very clear.
My old Sennheiser IE 4 earbuds
sound very muddy in comparison.

Some reviewers have found the bass
response of even the extended-range
ER2XR model lacking. Not so
in my case. There is plenty of
bass, and it is crisp and
responsive. Bass-heavy tracks such
as Dave Weckl's *Heads Up* or
Lee Ritenour and Larry Carlton's *After the Rain* are a
delightful listen.

In fact, I found myself pining
for more *treble*. The recurrent tambourine
in Ryan La Valette's *AMG Power* does not sound nearly
as sparkly as on what are
arguably the most premium cans I own, the
Beyerdynamic DT880 (250 Ω version). On the other
hand, the subtler high frequency response
does help tame down songs with
overly enthusiastic treble. I quite
enjoyed the Etymotics for Keith
Jarrett Trio's *All of You*, where they
rendered Jack DeJohnette's ride
cymbal a bit less piercing.

Some reviewers have opined that
the Etymotics have a poor, compressed
soundstage. Again, I did not find
this to be the case. Songs which
make clever use of panning the instruments
-- such as Peter Gabriel's *In Your Eyes* --
are rendered beautifully. Similarly,
I found little difference between
the Etymotic and the Beyerdynamic
DT880 for vocal music such as
Palestrina and Pärt.

Where the Etymotics really glow,
however, is when the music has
been meticulously recorded, mixed
and mastered. Listening to
Donald Fagen's *Snowbound* and
*Tomorrow's Girls* is an
absolute delight on these headphones.
It needs to be stressed, though,
that source quality and headphone
amplifier quality really matter.
Fagen sounded delightful when
played from CD and through my
JVC A-X3 amplifier; but only
so-so when streamed from
Youtube Music on a Samsung
tablet.

As with other IEMs, the cable has quite
a bit of microphonics. This can be a
problem if you're moving about a lot
when listening.


## When and where would I use these?

For me, the ideal context for the
Etymotic ER2XR is a busy café
or perhaps a train. The headphones
isolate mid and high frequencies
better than most active noise cancelling
headphones, but require no batteries
and are immune to the hiccups of
Bluetooth.

For their price, these headphones are
hard to beat in their category. The fit
may take some getting used to, but in
return you get excellent isolation which
really does make a difference in noisy
environments.


## Pros

- superior sound quality
- exceptional finish
- a wide assortment of eartips provided


## Cons

- so-and-so comfort
- lacklustre cable
- treble could do with a bit more oomph


## Specs

- frequency response: 20 Hz -- 16 kHz
- isolation: 35--42 dB
- impedance: 15 Ω at 1 kHz
- sensitivity: 96 dB at 1 kHz, 1 mW
- price: I paid 100 € for these


## Testing rigs

To evaluate these headphones, I
used the following setups and
music. Some (unblind, and hence
completely unscientific) AB testing
was done vis-à-vis Sennheiser IE 4
and Beyerdynamic DT880 Black Special 
Edition (250 Ω version).

### Rig A

- Onkyo DX-6530 CD player
- JVC A-X3 integrated stereo amplifier

### Rig B

- YouTube Music
- Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

- Donald Fagen: *Tomorrow's Girls*, from *Kamakiriad* (A, B)
- Keith Jarrett, Gary Peacock & Jack DeJohnette: *All of You*, from *Standards in Norway* (A)
