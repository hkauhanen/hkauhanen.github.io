      <description>I have always loved Italian espresso. Since the spring of 2020, when the Covid pandemic broke out and caf√©s were suddenly off-limits, I&amp;rsquo;ve also tried to reproduce it at home (with varying success). In the quest for the &amp;ldquo;God shot&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;ve cycled through more coffee-making equipment than I care to confess; among these are a multitude of grinders. I started with a humble Graef CM 800, then quickly progressed onto a Eureka Mignon Silenzio, a very capable grinder but with a number of quirks I didn&amp;rsquo;t care for (most importantly, the finicky little grind adjustment wheel).</description>

      <description>On a recent trip home, I rediscovered a vintage fountain pen I had bought years ago and then completely forgotten about. It&amp;rsquo;s a Wyvern 60C, a no-nonsense lever filler in unadorned black hard rubber. It&amp;rsquo;s probably worth nothing &amp;mdash; but that&amp;rsquo;s beside the point, as this pen is a very good writer. It has a 14ct gold nib, something like a medium with some amount of flex under moderate pressure.</description>
