      <description>My electronics hobby sometimes requires me to desolder components &amp;ndash; mostly traditional through-hole components &amp;ndash; off of printed circuit boards. Since this hasn&amp;rsquo;t been such a frequent occurrence, however, so far I&amp;rsquo;ve got by by using desoldering wick and one of those spring-operated desoldering pumps.
Recently though I wanted to salvage a power supply from a diseased tape deck for a project I was working on. Having done this, I was left with a PCB full of potentially useful components.</description>
