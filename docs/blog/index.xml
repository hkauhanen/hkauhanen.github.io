      <description>My electronics hobby sometimes requires me to desolder components &amp;ndash; mostly traditional through-hole components &amp;ndash; off of printed circuit boards. Since this hasn&amp;rsquo;t been such a frequent occurrence, however, so far I&amp;rsquo;ve got by by using desoldering wick and one of those spring-operated desoldering pumps.
Recently though I wanted to salvage a power supply from a diseased tape deck for a project I was working on. Having done this, I was left with a PCB full of potentially useful components.</description>

      <title>Anfim Best, part 1: Restoration</title>

      <description>I have always loved Italian espresso. Since the spring of 2020, when the Covid pandemic broke out and cafés were suddenly off-limits, I&amp;rsquo;ve also tried to reproduce it at home (with varying success). In the quest for the &amp;ldquo;God shot&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;ve cycled through more coffee-making equipment than I care to confess; among these are a multitude of grinders. I started with a humble Graef CM 800, then quickly progressed onto a Eureka Mignon Silenzio, a very capable grinder but with a number of quirks I didn&amp;rsquo;t care for (most importantly, the finicky little grind adjustment wheel).</description>

      <description>When the pandemic hit, I briefly looked for new inspiration for photography indoors before suddenly losing all passion for the hobby for about two years. This photo is one of the last I took before those two years of photographic depression.
Multiple exposure is a fun technique. Flamenco is a complex dance. I wanted to use the former to try to capture some of the complexity of the latter. So we pushed the living room sofa into a corner and my wife was generous enough to model in front of an ancient Minolta Autocord twin lens reflex camera propped on a tripod.</description>

      <title>Säntis</title>

      <description>Looking southward from Konstanz, the mountain of Säntis, some 50 km away in the Appenzell Alps, is clearly visible on most days. It is a modest peak in terms of summit height &amp;ndash; 2502 meters &amp;ndash; but stands very tall amongst its neighbours: Säntis is ultra-prominent, with a topographic prominence of 2021 meters. Having had a glimpse of it practically every day for the past five years, I was curious to get closer.</description>

      <title>Light restoration of a Wyvern 60C fountain pen</title>
      <link>https://hkauhanen.fi/blog/wyvern/</link>

      <description>On a recent trip home, I rediscovered a vintage fountain pen I had bought years ago and then completely forgotten about. It&amp;rsquo;s a Wyvern 60C, a no-nonsense lever filler in unadorned black hard rubber. It&amp;rsquo;s probably worth nothing &amp;mdash; but that&amp;rsquo;s beside the point, as this pen is a very good writer. It has a 14ct gold nib, something like a medium with some amount of flex under moderate pressure.</description>
